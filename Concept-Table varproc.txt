Table variable processing

Inputs:
$position = Where the tag begins
$tPosition = Where the tEnTableK is relative to position
$size = The full size of the tag
$tStart = Where the line processing ends for the first half of the tag
$start = Where the line processing ends for the second half of the tag

Implications:
$size-$tPosition = The size of the second half of the tag
$tPosition+1 = The size of the first half of the tag
$position+$tPosition = Where the tEnTableK tag is. (Impossible to prove in sanitized tests.)
$start-1 = Where the next chain tag is. (Impossible to prove in sanitized tests.)
($size-$tPosition)-($start-($position+$tPosition)) = The length from the start to the end tag. (Impossible to prove in sanitized tests.)

Proof of Implications:
[*table.html:@tableInput]
    $position	: 566
    $tPosition	: 11
    $size	: 23
    $tStart	: 566
    $start	: 578
Expected size of second half: 12 (@tableInput)
23-11 = 12 (Checks out)
Expected size of first half: 12 (*table.html)
11+1 = 12 (Checks out)


[*!thisLike:@!@thisLike]
    $position	: 616
    $tPosition	: 10
    $size	: 22
    $tStart	: 617
    $start	: 630
Expected size of second half: 12 (@!@thisLike)
22-10 = 12 (Checks out)
Expected size of first half: 11 (*!thisLike)
10+1 = 11 (Checks out)


What we need to do:
Process the first half of the tag for any unresolved piping.
Process the second half of the tag for any unresolved piping, 
	and ensure it ends with a variable or constant.

First half:
Fairly easy. if $position != $tStart, then get the first half of the tag 
	($position, $tPosition-1), run it through the ringer.

Second half:
First, check if $position+$tPosition+1 is @ or !. If not, just give up, because it's
	self evidently not a const or variable.
Second step, if ($tStart+$tPosition+1) != $start, we know that the second half
	is not lining up with what's unpiped, so we begin the pipe ringer.
	
Finally, we throw onto the respective stacks what we want to do.
